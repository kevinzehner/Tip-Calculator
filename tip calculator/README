This was a small yet effective project to practice my javascript skils. 
I used a simple UI for the html and css as i wanted to focus primarily on the javascript. 

To build the calculator i broke down the applications into smaller more managable pieces which i have outlined with my comments. 

the main javascript features i used for this project were some functions, an if else block, and an event listener
